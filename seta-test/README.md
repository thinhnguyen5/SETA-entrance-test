# SETA entrance test

## Javascript algorithm

1. Provide an array of strings, eg: [‘a’, ‘ab’, ‘abc’, ‘cd’, ‘def, ‘gh’]. Write a function to find the strings’ length that appear most in this array. Writing the unit test function and provide some test-cases. The result for example array is [‘ab’, ‘cd’, ‘gh’]

+ Find the solution in the Ex1.js file in the Javascript algorithm folder.+ Sort the array from smallest to largest based on element length.
+ Count is initialized to 1 to keep track of the occurrence of the current longest string length. Len is initialized to the length of the first element in the sorted array, representing the current longest string length seen so far. Best_count is initialized to 1 to store the maximum occurrence of any string length encountered. Best_len is initialized to len to store the length corresponding to best_count.
+ Then I use two loops, the first one to find the strings' length that appears most in this array and the best count the this string' length.
+ Use the loop one more time, for each element, if its length is equal to the best_len, it pushes that element into the result array.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
